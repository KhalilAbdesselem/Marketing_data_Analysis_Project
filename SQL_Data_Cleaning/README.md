## SQL Data Cleaning

This directory contains scripts and processes for cleaning and preparing data in SQL databases for analysis. It includes:

- **Data validation:** Scripts to identify and handle missing or inconsistent data.
- **Data transformation:** SQL queries to standardize data formats (e.g., dates, text), normalize values, and perform necessary calculations.
- **Error handling:** Mechanisms for identifying and correcting errors in the data (e.g., duplicates, invalid entries).
- **Optimization:** Techniques for improving data quality and performance, such as indexing and query optimization for large datasets.
- **Data profiling:** Scripts for analyzing data distributions and identifying outliers or anomalies.

These processes ensure that the data is accurate, consistent, and ready for further analysis or reporting.
